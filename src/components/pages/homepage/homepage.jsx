              So sweet and full of grace, <br />
              It flows like water through my soul, <br />
              And fills me with embrace.

              Your eyes are like the stars, <br />
              So bright and full of light, <br />
              They guide me through the darkness, <br />
              And keep me safe at night.

              Your smile is like the sun, <br />
              So warm and full of love,<br />
              It melts away my fears,<br />
              And makes me feel above.

              Your touch is like a dream,<br />
              So soft and full of peace,<br />
              It takes me to a place of magic,<br />
              Where nothing can be seen.
